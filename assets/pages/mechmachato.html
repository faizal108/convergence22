                                   3D Printing is an Additive Manufacturing technique that creates a physical object
                                   from a virtual 3D CAD model by depositing successive layers of material. Unlike your
                                   desktop printers, these print the object in a 3-dimensional format. <br>
                                   In this workshop, we will be covering 3d Printing or rapid prototyping, from
                                   designing your own parts to building your own printers! <br>

                                   ➔ After Takeoff, you have to make complete circuit (circle) in Air. (Diameter of

                                   this round without collision will lead to success in next round. Steps are as
                                   follows: <br>
                                   ➔ Takeoff RC plane. <br>
                                   ➔ Fly your RC plane through the pillars. Distance between two pillars = 15ft and
                                   height <br>
                                   of Your RC plane must not fly over pole height. <br>
                                   ➔ There are three pillars through which your plane shall pass in zigzag way. <br>
                                   ➔ When your RC plane pass between two pillars, you get 1 check point. <br>
                                   ➔ Land your RC plane. <br>
                                   ➔ Round 2 must be completed in single trial. No extra trials are permitted. <br>
                                   ➔ In case of collision with pillar, no check point will be given. If plane falls down
                                   then team will also lose landing points as given below. <br><br>

                                   In this final round, the team's ability to drop payload at target point will be

                                   ➔ Takeoff RC plane. <br>
                                   ➔ The coordinator will give you payload. You have to drop that payload in given

                                   1) The competition is based on time trail system. <br>
                                   2) The top team from qualifying round makes it to the next round on basis of time
                                   trials. <br>
                                   3) The game is divided into 3 rounds. <br>

                                   ➔ ROUND 1: <br>
                                   Participants have to reach the centre of maze in minimum time by controlling
                                   the robot

                                   Participants have to follow the directions given to them in chit and reach
                                   the centre of the
                                   maze in order to burst the balloon. The balloon will also have another chit that
                                   consists of directions to
                                   come out of the maze which must be followed by the participants. <br><br>

                                   ➔ ROUND 3: <br>
                                   Two robots of opposite teams will enter into the maze together from opposite
                                   side and have
                                   to bust the balloon which is at the centre of maze while following the directions
                                   given to them in the
                                   chit. <br><br>

                                   3) Wires should remain slack during the course of the run. Pulling the wire to aid
                                   the robot in traversing may lead to
                                   disqualification. <br>
                                   4) If any of the robots starts off before start up call, the counter would be
                                   restarted and the machines will get a
                                   second chance. If repeated again then team will be disqualified. <br>
                                   5) Your robot must be ready when call is made for your team. <br>
                                   6) Team members will be allowed only three times to touch or reset their robots
                                   position during the run. However,
                                   this will lead to a time penalty and timer will not stop during this course of
                                   action. <br>
                                   7) Machine must not contain any readymade kits, pneumatic &hydraulic systems, IC
                                   engines. <br>
                                   8) Decision about your robot will be taken by the organizers. <br>
                                   9) No team will get a second chance after completing the track with poor score.
