                              <p class="desc">
                                   Connections are structural elements that are used for joining different members of
                                   the structural steel framework. The steel structure is the assembly of different
                                   members like beams, and columns. These various steel members are interconnected using
                                   Rivets, Bolts, and Welding. This is known as a connection. <br><br>

                                   Connections can be of various types, based on different criteria. Based on the
                                   fastening method, the connections are of three types: rivets, Bolts, and Welding.
                                   Based on rigidity, the connections are of three types-Rigid, Simple, and Semi-rigid.
                                   <br><br>

                                   Steel's strength and resistance make it an exceptional material in terms of
                                   durability and economy. High impact and deformation resistance allow steel to be used
                                   in most large constructions as the main element of the supporting structure. <br><br>

                                   When one hears about steel and connections, the human brain always shows tall
                                   structures and bridges. The challenge includes designing the Installation/
                                   Model/Sculpture that must include steel joineries and connection with steel as a
                                   primary material. The specified material must be market readily available. <br><br>

                                   The proposed Installation/Model/Sculpture must not exceed the size limit of 10' x
                                   10'x 10' (LxBxH) or 3000 mm x 3000 mm x 3000 mm (LxBxH) at an actual scale of 1:1.

                                   ➔ This is a student-only competition. No faculty or staff members can participate in
                                   this event. <br>

                                   ➔ Any form of Copy or Duplication will lead to disqualification. <br>

                                   The most important quality of a design is the presentation reflecting the intentions
                                   behind it. It can present many different things and focus on one or more aspects like
                                   Spatial layout, Technical details, Material exploration, Structural Clarity, etc.

                                   ➔ Feasibility of Construction: <br>
                                   A beautiful piece is undeniably appealing, but its feasibility is more than just
                                   beauty. A feasibility study is an important tool for evaluating a project before
                                   starting it. By understanding the feasibility of a project, one can make better
                                   decisions about whether to move forward. <br><br>

                                   ➔ Impact: <br>
                                   When Communication and Aesthetics are perfectly combined, they produce an impactful
                                   image that is eagerly shared among the design-oriented community. The ingredients of
                                   an impactful design include Bold Geometry, Unusual angles, Rich color combination,
                                   Sharp contrast, Rhythmic pattern, and strong legibility among others. <br><br>
